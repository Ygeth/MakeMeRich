Tools Used
* Python - We will be using Python due to its ease of use. This tutorial assumes you already have Python installed and know how to run a Python program. The TWS API also has support for C++, Java, and C#, but these are beyond the scope of this tutorial.
* Visual Studio Code - Microsoft's popular open source code editor. To enable autocompletion and debugging, we will be using two VS Code extensions: the Python extension and the Pylance extension.
* Interactive Brokers TWS API (https://interactivebrokers.github.io/) - The official API for Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation (https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/trading-platforms.php). Note: we will be using the classic TWS, not IBKR Desktop.
* TradingView Lightweight Charts Python - an open source library by louisnw on Github that provides a pythonic interface to TradingView charts.


TWS API debe instalarse en la carpeta root del proyecto para despues hacer
cd https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/trading-platforms.php
